# Why Python

Here are a few paragraphs explaining why Python is used in ISYS3015:

Python is the programming language of choice for ISYS3015 because of its versatility in handling the data tasks and analyses that are common in business contexts. Python has become one of the most popular languages for data science, machine learning, and general-purpose programming.

Firstly, Python has an easy-to-read syntax and dynamic, flexible design that is great for new programmers. This makes it accessible for students who are just starting out coding in an information systems curriculum. The large number of high-quality libraries for mathematical/statistical computing and data manipulation also make Python well-suited for the data-heavy focus of information systems. 

In particular, libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn provide excellent tools for loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data with just a few lines of Python code. These capabilities are invaluable for the data workflows and hands-on projects students will undertake in ISYS3015.

Additionally, Python lends itself well to developing APIs and backend services, which are important in modern business software systems. Its versatility across data science, web development, and system automation also makes Python a valuable language to learn for future careers in technology and business.

Overall, Python provides an accessible yet powerful programming environment for ISYS3015 students to grasp core programming concepts and tackle real-world data problems similar to what they will see working in industry. The skills learned through hands-on Python coding will equip students with computational thinking approaches relevant to today's data-driven business landscape.

# Why Jupyter/Python Notebooks

We are using Jupyter Notebooks in this course because they provide an interactive environment to run Python code and analyze data. Unlike plain Python scripts, Notebooks allow you to combine code, formatted text, plots, and other rich output all in one document. This is useful for data science workflows where you may want to provide context around your code with markdown headers, documentation, and visualizations. 

The nonlinear execution model of Notebooks also supports an exploratory style of programming - you can run cells independently to rapidly prototype analyses. This iterative approach lends itself well to data tasks where you may need to frequently change parameters or transform data in different ways. Being able to see plots and outputs automatically without rerunning the entire script accelerates these iterative cycles.

Overall, Notebooks provide a more intuitive workflow for learners to understand core data analysis concepts in Python. By combining code, text, math, and figures, Notebooks help connect the dots between coding statements and their purpose within a data science methodology. This environment facilitates learning data skills in a visual, interactive manner.

# Why VSCode

We are using VSCode in this course because it provides a full-featured integrated development environment for writing Python code. Unlike simple text editors, VSCode gives you helpful features like syntax highlighting, auto-completion, debugging tools, Git integration, and extensions for Python programming. These capabilities streamline writing, testing, and deploying Python code. 

Specifically, the debugging support in VSCode allows you to set breakpoints, inspect variables, and step through your code. This is extremely valuable for new Python programmers to understand what your code is doing under the hood. The built-in terminal also enables you to run Python scripts and tools right within the editor. 

Additionally, VSCode has a huge extension ecosystem, so you can customize it for your specific needs. There are linter extensions to catch bugs and optimize your code, preview tools for rendering Markdown and Jupyter Notebooks, and addons for connecting VSCode directly to platforms like GitHub.

Overall, VSCode provides an efficient and feature-rich editing environment for Python development. Using VSCode in this course will speed up your coding and debugging workflows compared to less fully-featured text editors. The extensions and customizations also allow you to mold the editor to your preferences as you grow your Python skills.

# Why Git/Github

Using Git and GitHub provides important version control capabilities for managing and tracking changes to code over time. Git enables developers to commit changes to their local repository, go back to previous versions, branch off to experiment, and merge code between branches. This gives fine-grained control over a project's evolution. GitHub then provides a centralized remote repository to push commits to from any developer's local clone. This drives collaboration by allowing developers to share their latest code, keep their local copies in sync, and contribute to the same project together. GitHub's pull requests and code reviews streamline this collaboration workflow. Overall, Git and GitHub help developers methodically track progress, contribute simultaneously without conflicts, and maintain a complete history of code changes across an entire team. These tools are invaluable nowadays for any multi-developer software project.
